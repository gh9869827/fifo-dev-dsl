class SameAsPreviousIntent(DSLValueBase):
    """
    Reuse the value of the same slot from the immediately preceding intent.

    This node acts as a placeholder for a slot value that should be copied
    from the previous intent. During resolution, it is replaced with the
    value from the same-named slot in the most recent intent.

    This is useful when the user makes a follow-up request that implicitly refers
    to a previously specified value â€” such as saying "the same size" or "again".

    Example:
        Input:
            "Give me two screws of 12mm, and then four of the same size."
        Output:
            retrieve_screw(count=2, length=12),
            retrieve_screw(count=4, length=SAME_AS_PREVIOUS_INTENT())
