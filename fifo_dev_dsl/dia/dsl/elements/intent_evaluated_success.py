class IntentEvaluatedSuccess(DslBase):
    """
    Marks that an intent has successfully completed evaluation.

    This node wraps a previously executed intent and stores its evaluation outcome,
    including return values and status. It prevents redundant re-execution by
    preserving results from earlier stages in the DSL evaluation process.

    This mechanism is essential for non-idempotent operations or side-effecting
    actions â€” for example, if a robot has already moved or an item was deleted,
    re-evaluating that intent could cause incorrect behavior. By wrapping the intent
    in a success marker, we ensure correct recovery and safe replay during error
    handling or full-tree re-evaluation.

    Attributes:
        intent (Intent):
            The intent that completed without errors.

        evaluation_outcome (EvaluationOutcome):
            The result of evaluating the intent, including its return value and status.
