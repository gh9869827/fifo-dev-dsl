class AbortWithNewDsl(DslBase):
    """
    Abort the current resolution path and replace it with a new DSL subtree.

    Like `Abort`, this node signals that the current resolution path is no longer valid.
    However, instead of terminating execution, it returns `ResolutionResult.NEW_DSL_NODES`
    with the provided `new_dsl`, allowing the resolver to continue with a new intent sequence.

    This is useful for graceful redirectionâ€”for example, when a requested item is unavailable
    and an alternative path should be proposed.

        new_dsl (ListElement):
            DSL elements that will replace the aborted intent subtree.

        that resolution is incomplete and should not remain in a fully resolved
